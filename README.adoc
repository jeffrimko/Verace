== Introduction
This project provides a Python 2.7/3.x library to aid checking strings in files. Verace's main use case is checking that version strings are consistent in project files. The main features of this library are:

  - Custom parse any project files for strings.
  - Easily determine if all strings are consistent.
  - Quickly updated tracked strings.
  - Should work on any platform without additional dependencies; https://github.com/jeffrimko/Qprompt[Qprompt] is recommended for default prompts.

== Status
Currently, this project is in the **development release** stage. While this project is suitable for use, please note that there may be incompatibilities in new releases.

== Requirements
Verace should run on any Python 2.7/3.x interpreter without additional dependencies.

== Installation
Verace can be installed with pip using the following command: `pip install verace`

Additional, Verace can be installed from source by running: `python setup.py install`

== Usage
Start by importing Verace into your Python script:

[source,python]
--------
import verace
--------

Create a `VerChecker` object, name it and set the root location:

[source,python]
--------
mychk = verace.VerChecker("My Checker", __file__)
--------

Include a file to check. If no check function is provided, `check_basic()` will be used by default. Let's look for the version string in `setup.py`:

[source,python]
--------
mychk.include(r"lib\setup.py", match="version = ", splits=[('"',1)])
--------

Get the string found by the checker:

[source,python]
--------
print("version found = " + mychk.string())
# version found = 0.4.1
--------

The string can be updated in all associated files:

[source,python]
--------
mychk.update("something different!")
--------

That's the basics. Check out http://verace.readthedocs.io[the documentation] for more info.

== Q&A
How is **Verace** pronounced?

  - "ver-AH-che" - Italian word for "truthful/accurate".

Is this library only for Python projects?

  - Not at all! Any project can use Verace!
